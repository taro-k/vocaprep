# For developer

Vocaprep aims to help English study by instantly making custom-made
vocabulary notebooks (voca-note) from media such as text including webpages
and ebooks or subtitle files (.srt etc) of movies before you begin to
read/watch. You will feel readings/watchings are easier after you studied
the custom-made voca-note generated by Vocaprep.

For example,

1. Vocaprep makes a voca-note of words which appears in the movie but is
probably unknow by you from its subtitle file.
2. Then, you study the voca-note and remember the word meanings.
3. Finally, you watch the movie. Wow, you understand every word in the
movie! (If you can listne :-P )

At this moment, Vocaprep is English-Japanese version, but every developer
for other languages is really welcome.

To get levels of words and Japanese meaning, Vocaprep uses an API:
